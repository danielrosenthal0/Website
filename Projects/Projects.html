                        <li>Ultrasonic eyes was a project in my electrical engineering class</li>
                        <li>The goal was to create a project and instructions using an Arduino so that freshmen engineering students would be able to complete the project</li>
                        <li>I created this ultrasonic eyes device using two ultrasonic sensors, two LED matrices, an Arduino Uno, and a custom 3D printed housing</li>
                        <li>The gif shows the device in action - it follows whatever object is placed in front of it as the object moves horizontally</li>
                        <li>The image shows the final design of the eyes, but I unfortunately did not take a video with the new eyes before the project was submitted</li>

                        <li>Last summer, I worked in Professor Kyle Luthy's Lab at Wake Forest University. While this was a remote position due to COVID, I was able to work on a few things to assist in his research</li>
                        <li>Professor Luthy's research is varied but generally focuses on environmental monitoring using pretty sweet devices</li>
                        <li>One facet of his research is the monitoring of controlled grassland burns in the areas surrounding Wake Forest with drones and remote sensors</li>
                        <li>My work began with setting up multiple Raspberry Pi atmospheric sensors to eventually be put to use in a <a class = "active" href = "https://www.icdp.ucar.edu/core-programs-1/3dpaws/" target = "_blank" rel = "noopener noreferrer">3D PAWS weather station</a> </li>
                        <li>Once these were set up, my next task was to set up a dashboard to display this data</li>
                        <li>We elected to use the <a class="active" href="http://3d.chordsrt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CHORDS</a> portal to receive and display this data and we hosted the site on AWS EC2</li>
                        <li>I set up the portal by asdding specific instruments to our site and then sending loads of test data</li>
                        <li>The portal only displays data at a frequency of every minute so my next task was to see if we could send data more rapidly to the dashboard. We wanted to reach higher frequencies of data transmission because the sensors are monitroing very fast fires as they move across a grassland</li>
                        <li>I wrote a few scripts to generate fake data and send that newly-generated data to the dashboard, seen <a class="active" href="https://github.com/danielrosenthal0/luthy_labs" target="_blank" ref = "noopener noreferrer">here</a></li>
